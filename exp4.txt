Aim : To install Jenkins and configure parallel jobs for building pipeline.

{ ##First Install jenkins if not there in system 

    sudo su root
    # apt-get update
    # apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk
    # java -version
    
    # curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \ 
    > /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc 
    > /dev/null
    
    # echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
    > https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
    > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
    
    # sudo apt-get update
    # jenkins --version
    # sudo ufw status
    # sudo ufw enable
    # sudo ufw status 
    ----> Open the jenkins through website ----> http://localhost:8080
    # sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword ----> use this command if jenkins asks for authentication
}

{ ##Install "Build Pipeline" Plugin

    Manage Jenkins -> Plugins -> Available Plugins -> In the Search bar, type: Build Pipeline -> Install the Plugin ( Tick the checkbox next to Build Pipeline Plugin , Click Install without restart )

2)	In all item Build Step -> Execute Shell
      Type:
      sleep 10
      echo "This is test phase" ------>For Test Item similarly change the text for other 2 tests i.e only change test to staging , production

Part I: Demo on concept of  continuous delivery :
3)	Go to : test -> configure -> Post-build Actions -> Build other projects -> staging
4)  Go to : staging -> configure -> Post-build Actions -> Build other projects -> production

Goto Dashboard, Now you need to click on plus icon ( it will be their in something like menu bar ), New view:- Name: continuous delivery , And type: "build pipeline view" and click on create.
and scroll down and look for your -> select initial job : test

5)	test -> job -> configure -> Post-build Actions -> Build other projects -> staging,QA-test -> tick "Trigger only if build is stable" ->save
6)	Run the Build Pipeline View
