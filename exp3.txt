Aim : To understand and perform version control system / source code management using Git Branch.

sudo apt update
sudo su 

{

    # sudo apt update
    # apt install git    // sudo apt-get install git
    # git --version
    # git config --global user.name "your_username"
    # git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com@gmail.com"
    # git config --list
    
    To Integrate Git account with Github:
    Goto www.github.com
    Sign-in to your account
    Create a Repository -> Repo name= , Description = Setting up Git , Public, click Add readme file and create Repo
    
}

# mkdir workspace
# cd workspace/
# ls ----> e.g. output hello_test
# cd hello_test/
# git branch 
# git branch APSIT
# git branch  ----> * mark will be on main/master 
# git checkout APSIT 
# git branch ----> * mark will be on APSIT

# echo " This text was added originally while in the APSIT branch " >> hello.py
# cat hello.py
# gedit hellpy ----> write this code on file ----> print("Hello Devops")
# cat hello.py
# git status
# git add hello.py
# git status

# git commit -m "Added a line in APSIT branch"
# git log
# git checkout main
# git branch
# git merge APSIT
# cat hello.py
# git push -u origin main ----> if it didnt work / it works with error ----> # git push -u origin main --force

# git remote set-url origin https://<YOUR_TOKEN>@github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<Your REPO NAME>
{
  Go to your GitHub account. Navigate to: Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Tokens (classic).
  Click "Generate new token (classic)" and check repo option and click Generate Token and copy paste it somewhere
}

# git push -u origin main ----> # Goto Github Account and see the update


Conclusion:
In this experiment, we understood the use case of Version Control System in branching
Compiled By Prof. Sujata Oak
and merging, its benefits in real time scenario which provides a application of branching
the changes when people are in working in a collaborating environment. Different
commands were used for the same such as checkout, branch and merge for displaying the
changes between the initial and latter texts.
